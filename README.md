## Overview

LibreChat UI is a native desktop application wrapper for self-hosted LibreChat instances, built using Electron. This application provides a convenient way to access your LibreChat instance directly from your desktop.

## Features

- Native desktop application for LibreChat
- Keyboard shortcuts
  - `Cmd/Ctrl+N`: Clicks 'New Chat' button
  - `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S`: Toggle sidebar
  - `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`: Toggle private chat
  - `Ctrl+K`: Scroll up
  - `Ctrl+J`: Scroll down
  - `Ctrl+U`: Scroll to top
  - `Ctrl+D`: Scroll to bottom
- Cross-platform support (for now it's just macOS, but feel free to request more OS support)
- Easy access to self-hosted or [managed](https://librechat-librechat.hf.space) LibreChat instances

## Installation

Grab the executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/leikoilja/librechat-ui/releases) page or follow the instructions below to build the application yourself.

### macOS

Get the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/leikoilja/LibreChat-UI/releases) page, open the .dmg file and drag the app to your Applications folder.

Due to current code signing configurations (or lack thereof) the macOS releases may trigger Gatekeeper warnings ("App is damaged" or "Unidentified developer").

If you encounter this:

1.  **Move the app to your Applications folder.** This is important.
2.  **Open Terminal:** Open the Terminal application on your Mac.
3.  **Remove Quarantine Attribute:** Run the following command in the Terminal, replacing `/Applications/LibreChat UI.app` with the actual path to the LibreChat UI application if you moved it elsewhere:

    ```bash
    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/LibreChat UI.app"
    ```

    *   **Note:** `xattr` is a command-line tool for manipulating extended attributes of files. The `com.apple.quarantine` attribute is added to downloaded files as a security measure by macOS.

4.  **Open the Application:** You should now be able to open the application. You may still see a warning about the developer being unidentified, but you should be able to proceed.

**Why is this necessary?**

Ideally, the application would be properly code-signed to avoid these warnings. However, until code signing is fully configured in the automated build process, this workaround is required.

### Manual Installation
